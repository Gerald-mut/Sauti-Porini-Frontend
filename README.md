## Overview

The **Sauti Porini Dashboard** is a tactical 3D visualization interface designed for forest rangers. It renders real-time threat data on a 3D terrain map of Kakamega Forest, allowing rangers to distinguish between satellite alerts, acoustic sensor triggers, and verified citizen reports.

## Key Features

- **3D Terrain Visualization:** Uses Mapbox GL JS to render realistic topography (hills/valleys) for better patrol planning.
- **Live Data Layers:**
  - **Red Pulse:** Satellite deforestation alerts.
  - **Yellow Waves:** Acoustic sensor detections (chainsaws).
  - **Blue Pins:** Verified citizen USSD reports.
- **Glassmorphism UI:** A modern, dark-mode "Heads Up Display" (HUD) aesthetic using Tailwind CSS.
- **Actionable Intelligence:**
  - **Voice of the Forest:** One-click petition generation based on alert coordinates.
  - **Blockchain Verification:** Displays SHA-256 hash badges on reports to prove authenticity.

## Tech Stack

- **Core:** React.js (Vite)
- **Mapping:** react-map-gl, mapbox-gl
